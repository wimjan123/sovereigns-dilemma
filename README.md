## Overview

**The Sovereign's Dilemma** is an innovative political simulation game where you govern entirely through a fictional desktop interface. Navigate the complex world of Dutch politics as you rise to power, win elections, and attempt to fix real issues while the world argues back.

### Core Concept

Experience authentic Dutch political dynamics through:
- **Real-time Social Media**: Write free-form posts that trigger AI-generated conversations
- **Dynamic Voter Simulation**: 10,000+ simulated voters with memory, loyalties, and evolving opinions
- **Coalition Politics**: Navigate Netherlands-specific coalition formation and government mechanics
- **Consequential Decisions**: Every choice has delayed, tangible effects on society and stability

## Key Features

### üó≥Ô∏è **Authentic Dutch Politics**
- 17+ major political parties with accurate ideological positioning
- Regional demographic variations (urban vs rural, noord vs zuid)
- Coalition formation mechanics true to Dutch parliamentary system
- Real Dutch political issues: immigration, climate, economy, housing

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Interactions**
- NVIDIA NIM API integration for Dutch language processing
- Intelligent voter responses based on political spectrum analysis
- Adaptive AI opponents with strategic campaign behavior
- Procedural content generation for news, scandals, and crises

### üìä **Deep Simulation Systems**
